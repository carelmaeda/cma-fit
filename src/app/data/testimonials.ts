      "Training with Justin has been transformative! When I first started working out, group exercise was very effective- I lost a bunch of weight. When my fitness plateaued, it was Justin’s customized programming, attention to form and ‘gentle motivation’ that pushed me through to new goals. His welcoming personality and passion for physical health are contagious and I genuinely look forward to our sessions!",
